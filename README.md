 List Pagination and Filtering
 
 In this project, I used a common web development technique known as 'pagination' to enhance the usability and the user experience of a web page.
 
 Extra activity: creation of a serach bar that filters the names in real time as the user types.
 
 Expecting grade: 'Exceed expectations'.
